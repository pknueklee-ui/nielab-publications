    abstract: Miniaturization of electronic components and advances in flexible and
      stretchable materials have stimulated the development of wearable health care
      systems that can reflect and monitor personal health status by health care professionals.
      New skin-mountable devices that offer seamless contact onto the human skin,
      even under large deformations by natural motions of the wearer, provide a route
      for both high-fidelity monitoring and patient-controlled therapy. This article
      provides an overview of sev...

    abstract: AbstractLow‐voltage operation and fast switching ability are necessary
      for wearable electronic devices. Recently, electrolyte dielectric materials
      have been widely used to decrease driving voltages; however, they often exhibit
      unwanted doping effects and power dissipation problems. Here, a method for dramatically
      lowering driving voltages is reported in organic electronics via source‐gated
      transistor (SGT) structures. SGTs are fabricated by evaporating asymmetric metals
      with different work funct...

    abstract: AbstractRecent interest in flexible electronics has led to a paradigm
      shift in consumer electronics, and the emergent development of stretchable and
      wearable electronics is opening a new spectrum of ubiquitous applications for
      electronics. Organic electronic materials, such as π‐conjugated small molecules
      and polymers, are highly suitable for use in low‐cost wearable electronic devices,
      and their charge‐carrier mobilities have now exceeded that of amorphous silicon.
      However, their commercializat...
