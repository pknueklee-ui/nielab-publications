  abstract: AbstractOrganic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show significant promise
    for bioelectronics and neuromorphic computing applications due to their low operating
    voltage, biocompatibility, and ion‐mediated charge transport. However, conventional
    OECTs with permanently fixed organic semiconductor (OSC) layers lack modularity
    and reusability for sustainable electronics with e‐waste reduction. Here, a novel
    reinforced π‐ion film OECT featuring a detachable and reusable OSC layer that
    creates a unified composite with dielectric and gate components, establishing
    a new paradigm for modular device architectures is proposed. Through solvent exchange
    and mesh‐supported gelation, π‐ion film exhibits enhanced mechanical stability,
    detachability, and superior electrical performance. The OECTs demonstrate remarkable
    35‐day air stability, 50‐day storage lifetime, and over 80% performance retention
    after 600 electrical cycles. Furthermore, the π‐ion film OECTs exhibit synaptic
    behavior with paired‐pulse facilitation of 167% and long‐term memory retention
    of 34% maintained synaptic current after 250 s. These characteristics enable reservoir
    computing applications with a 4‐bit encoding scheme for image recognition, processing
    16 × 16 pixelated input patterns, demonstrating reliable state differentiation
    and stable signal retention. Even at lab‐scale development, reinforced π‐ion film
    OECTs represent a promising eco‐friendly platform for modular, reusable components
    in next‐generation neuromorphic computing systems, aligning with electronic waste
    reduction policies by enabling component reuse.

  abstract: AbstractSolution‐processed organic single‐crystal semiconductors (OSCSs)
    with high charge transport properties are being actively studied. However, OSCSs
    show relatively low intrinsic conductivity in electronic devices compared to inorganic
    semiconductors. This problem can be solved through doping technology applied to
    OSCSs. In this study, the enhancement of conductivity and photosensitivity of
    n‐type OSCS microwires (MWs) based on a small molecular semiconductor and an n‐type
    organic cationic dye‐based dopant is reported. Transmission and scanning electron
    microscopy show the attachment of n‐type dopants to the terrace edge of OSCS MWs,
    enabling rapid electron transfer and strong interaction. The n‐type doped OSCS
    MWs show enhanced conductivity and high optoelectronic properties, exhibiting
    5,000 times improved photoresponsivity of 1.86 × 104 A W−1 compared to the OSC
    films fabricated by a thermal evaporation method. Furthermore, the fast photo‐response
    time of n‐type doped OSCS MW is measured to be 0.16 s. In addition, the high‐performance
    photo‐neuromorphic characteristics using the hole trap effect of cationic dye
    and applications including Pavlov's dog phenomenon showing conditioned reflex
    characteristics and image recognition using 4‐bit reservoir encoding are demonstrated.
    The developed high‐performance organic photoelectronic devices in this study can
    be utilized as essential components in future advanced artificial intelligence
    electronic devices applied to image sensing and optical communications.

  abstract: AbstractOrganic field‐effect transistor (OFET)‐based photodetectors have
    been extensively studied owing to their potential applications in various fields,
    such as imaging, communication, and environmental monitoring. However, the traditional
    OFET structure brings about high power consumption. Furthermore, their low electrical
    performance and light sensitivity must be improved to detect harmful UV rays that
    accelerate skin aging and cause vision degradation. One strategy to fabricate
    high‐performance phototransistors involves the introduction of molybdenum trioxide
    (MoO3), which serves as a dopant for pentacene, aiming to enhance electrical performance
    by increasing mobility and decreasing threshold voltage. In addition, the photoreactivity
    of MoO3 in the UV spectrum is utilized to achieve enhanced light responsivity.
    In this work, a suboptimal source‐gated transistor (sSGT) is introduced instead
    of a conventional OFET to exploit the work function difference between two electrodes
    and the active layer to achieve low‐power consumption. The power of the sSGT is
    1000 times lower than that of the OFET, demonstrating the low‐power consumption.
    The findings indicate the potential fabrication method of high‐performance UV
    phototransistors with low‐power consumption induced by incorporating the MoO3
    and sSGT structure.

  abstract: 'AbstractArtificial synapses, inspired by the intricate design of biological
    synapses, utilize electrical, chemical, and mechanical signals to transmit and
    retain information. Recent advances have involved research on artificial synapses
    based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), emphasizing low power consumption
    and rapid response times. A notable challenge arises when the gate voltage is
    removed, causing doped ions to return quickly to the electrolyte. A simple yet
    efficient approach is used to solve this problem: forming a microporous active
    layer using a phase separation method. This technique can maximize the contact
    area between the electrolyte and the active layer, enhancing ion doping/de‐doping
    in OECTs. Improvements in the product of hole mobility and volumetric capacitance
    is achieved. The electrostatic coupling effect and electrochemical doping in synaptic
    OECTs occur better than in the pristine active layer, yielding enhanced performance
    with higher short‐term and long‐term synaptic plasticity, compared to pristine
    OECTs. Moreover, improved ambipolar characteristics is shown by n‐dopant injection.
    This paper reports a way to improve performance by simply modifying the surface
    shape of the active layer using the phase separation, contributing to advancements
    in artificial synapses for neural networks.'

  abstract: AbstractPoly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS),
    a conductive polymer, has gained popularity as the channel layer in organic electrochemical
    transistors (OECTs) due to its high conductivity and straightforward processing.
    However, difficulties arise in controlling its conductivity through gate voltage,
    presenting a challenge. To address this issue, aromatic amidine base, diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non‐5‐ene
    (DBN), is used to stabilize the doping state of the PEDOT chain through a reliable
    chemical de‐doping process. Furthermore, the addition of the proton‐penetrable
    material Nafion to the PEDOT:PSS channel layer induces phase separation between
    the substances. By utilizing a solution containing both PEDOT:PSS and Nafion as
    the channel layer of OECTs, the efficiency of ion movement into the channel from
    the electrolyte is enhanced, resulting in improved OECT performance. The inclusion
    of Nafion in the OECTs’ channel layer modifies ion movement dynamics, allowing
    for the adjustment of synaptic properties such as pulse‐paired facilitation, memory
    level, short‐term plasticity, and long‐term plasticity. This research aims to
    introduce new possibilities in the field of neuromorphic computing and contribute
    to biomimetic technology through the enhancement of electronic component performance.

  abstract: The life expectancy of humans has been significantly elevated due to advancements
    in medical knowledge and skills over the past few decades. Although a lot of knowledge
    and skills are disseminated to the general public, electronic devices that quantitatively
    diagnose one’s own body condition still require specialized semiconductor devices
    which are huge and not portable. In this regard, semiconductor materials that
    are lightweight and have low power consumption and high performance should be
    developed with low cost for mass production. Organic semiconductors are one of
    the promising materials in biomedical applications due to their functionalities,
    solution-processability and excellent mechanical properties in terms of flexibility.
    In this review, we discuss organic semiconductor materials that are widely utilized
    in biomedical devices. Some advantageous and unique properties of organic semiconductors
    compared to inorganic semiconductors are reviewed. By critically assessing the
    fabrication process and device structures in organic-based biomedical devices,
    the potential merits and future aspects of the organic biomedical devices are
    pinpointed compared to inorganic devices.

  abstract: To increase the human lifespan, healthcare monitoring devices that diagnose
    diseases and check body conditions have attracted considerable interest. Commercial
    AgCl-based wet electrodes with the advantages of high conductivity and strong
    adaptability to human skin are considered the most frequently used electrode material
    for healthcare monitoring. However, commercial AgCl-based wet electrodes, when
    exposed for a long period, cause an evaporation of organic solvents, which could
    reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of biosignals and stimulate human skin. In this
    context, we demonstrate a dry electrode for a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
    (PEDOT:PSS)-based blended polymer electrode using a combination of PEDOT:PSS,
    waterborne polyurethane (WPU) and ethylene glycol (EG) that could be reused for
    a long period of time to detect electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography
    (EMG). Both ECG and EMG are reliably detected by the wireless real-time monitoring
    system. In particular, the proposed dry electrode detects biosignals without deterioration
    for over 2 weeks. Additionally, a double layer of a polyimide (PI) substrate and
    fluorinated polymer CYTOP induces the strong waterproof characteristics of external
    liquids for the proposed dry electrodes, having a low surface energy of 14.49
    mN/m. In addition, the proposed electrode has excellent degradability in water;
    it dissolves in hot water at 60 °C.

  abstract: With the advent of human–machine interaction and the Internet of Things,
    wearable and flexible vibration sensors have been developed to detect human voices
    and surrounding vibrations transmitted to humans. However, previous wearable vibration
    sensors have limitations in the sensing performance, such as frequency response,
    linearity of sensitivity, and esthetics. In this study, a transparent and flexible
    vibration sensor was developed by incorporating organic/inorganic hybrid materials
    into ultrathin membranes. The sensor exhibited a linear and high sensitivity (20
    mV/g) and a flat frequency response (80–3000 Hz), which are attributed to the
    wheel-shaped capacitive diaphragm structure fabricated by exploiting the high
    processability and low stiffness of the organic material SU-8 and the high conductivity
    of the inorganic material ITO. The sensor also has sufficient esthetics as a wearable
    device because of the high transparency of SU-8 and ITO. In addition, the temperature
    of the post-annealing process after ITO sputtering was optimized for the high
    transparency and conductivity. The fabricated sensor showed significant potential
    for use in transparent healthcare devices to monitor the vibrations transmitted
    from hand-held vibration tools and in a skin-attachable vocal sensor.

  abstract: AbstractRecently, studies of 2D organic layered materials with unique
    electronic properties have generated considerable interest in the research community.
    However, the development of organic materials with functional electrical transport
    properties is still needed. Here, a 2D fused aromatic network (FAN) structure
    with a C5N basal plane stoichiometry is designed and synthesized, and thin films
    are cast from C5N solution onto silicon dioxide substrates. Then field‐effect
    transistors are fabricated using C5N thin flakes as the active layer in a bottom‐gate
    top‐contact configuration to characterize their electrical properties. The C5N
    thin flakes, isolated by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, exhibit ambipolar charge
    transport and extraordinarily high electron (996 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole (501 cm2
    V−1 s−1) mobilities, surpassing the performance of most pristine organic materials
    without doping. These results demonstrate their vast potential for applications

  abstract: AbstractThe vision system of arthropods consists of a dense array of individual
    photodetecting elements across a curvilinear surface. This compound‐eye architecture
    could be a useful model for optoelectronic sensing devices that require a large
    field of view and high sensitivity to motion. Strategies that aim to mimic the
    compound‐eye architecture involve integrating photodetector pixels with a curved
    microlens, but their fabrication on a curvilinear surface is challenged by the
    use of standard microfabrication processes that are traditionally designed for
    planar, rigid substrates (e.g., Si wafers). Here, a fractal web design of a hemispherical
    photodetector array that contains an organic‐dye‐sensitized graphene hybrid composite
    is reported to serve as an effective photoactive component with enhanced light‐absorbing
    capabilities. The device is first fabricated on a planar Si wafer at the microscale
    and then transferred to transparent hemispherical domes with different curvatures
    in a deterministic manner. The unique structural property of the fractal web design
    provides protection of the device from damage by effectively tolerating various
    external loads. Comprehensive experimental and computational studies reveal the
    essential design features and optoelectronic properties of the device, followed
    by the evaluation of its utility in the measurement of both the direction and
    intensity of incident light.

  abstract: AbstractLow‐voltage operation and fast switching ability are necessary
    for wearable electronic devices. Recently, electrolyte dielectric materials have
    been widely used to decrease driving voltages; however, they often exhibit unwanted
    doping effects and power dissipation problems. Here, a method for dramatically
    lowering driving voltages is reported in organic electronics via source‐gated
    transistor (SGT) structures. SGTs are fabricated by evaporating asymmetric metals
    with different work functions for the source and drain electrodes. Versatile organic
    semiconductor‐based SGTs demonstrate a significantly lower drain voltage (&lt;10
    V) for the saturation regime compared to that of typical field‐effect transistors
    with the same dielectric layer (&gt;80 V). Furthermore, coating reduced Pyronin
    B (rPyB) onto n‐type SGTs decreases the threshold voltage from 51.2 to 0.1 eV
    and improves air‐stability, exhibiting a maintained electron mobility (&gt;90%)
    for 40 d. The air‐stability is due to both the energetic and kinetic factors,
    including a decreased lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of the n‐type
    semiconductor after doping and covering the active layer with rPyB. Finally, flexible
    SGTs are fabricated on a Parylene‐C substrate that shows highly stable operation
    in a bending test. The results demonstrate a promising technology for low‐power,
    flexible electronic devices via electrode engineering.

  abstract: AbstractRecent interest in flexible electronics has led to a paradigm
    shift in consumer electronics, and the emergent development of stretchable and
    wearable electronics is opening a new spectrum of ubiquitous applications for
    electronics. Organic electronic materials, such as π‐conjugated small molecules
    and polymers, are highly suitable for use in low‐cost wearable electronic devices,
    and their charge‐carrier mobilities have now exceeded that of amorphous silicon.
    However, their commercialization is minimal, mainly because of weaknesses in terms
    of operational stability, long‐term stability under ambient conditions, and chemical
    stability related to fabrication processes. Recently, however, many attempts have
    been made to overcome such instabilities of organic electronic materials. Here,
    an overview is provided of the strategies developed for environmentally robust
    organic electronics to overcome the detrimental effects of various critical factors
    such as oxygen, water, chemicals, heat, and light. Additionally, molecular design
    approaches to π‐conjugated small molecules and polymers that are highly stable
    under ambient and harsh conditions are explored; such materials will circumvent
    the need for encapsulation and provide a greater degree of freedom using simple
    solution‐based device‐fabrication techniques. Applications that are made possible
    through these strategies are highlighted.

  abstract: Highly flexible organic nanofiber phototransistors are fabricated on a
    highly flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) textile/poly(dimethylsiloxane)
    (PDMS) composite substrate. Organic nanofibers are obtained by electrospinning,
    using a mixture of poly(3,3″′‐didodecylquarterthiophene) (PQT‐12) and poly(ethylene
    oxide) (PEO) as the semiconducting polymer and processing aid, respectively. PDMS
    is used as both a buffer layer for flattening the PET textile and a dielectric
    layer in the bottom‐gate bottom‐contact device configuration. PQT‐12:PEO nanofibers
    can be well‐aligned on the textile composite substrate by electrospinning onto
    a rotating drum collector. The nanofiber phototransistors fabricated on the PET/PDMS
    textile composite substrate show highly stable device performance (on‐current
    retention up to 82.3 (±6.7)%) under extreme bending conditions, with a bending
    radius down to 0.75 mm and repeated tests over 1000 cycles, while those prepared
    on film‐type PET and PDMS‐only substrates exhibit much poorer performances. The
    photoresponsive behaviors of PQT‐12:PEO nanofiber phototransistors have been investigated
    under light irradiation with different wavelengths. The maximum photoresponsivity,
    photocurrent/dark‐current ratio, and external quantum efficiency under blue light
    illumination were 930 mA W−1, 2.76, and 246%, respectively. Furthermore, highly
    flexible 10 × 10 photosensor arrays have been fabricated which are able to detect
    incident photonic signals with high resolution. The flexible photosensors described
    herein have high potential for applications as wearable photosensors.

  abstract: AbstractHeteroatom‐doping into graphitic networks has been utilized for
    opening the band gap of graphene. However, boron‐doping into the graphitic framework
    is extremely limited, whereas nitrogen‐doping is relatively feasible. Herein,
    boron/nitrogen co‐doped graphene (BCN‐graphene) is directly synthesized from the
    reaction of CCl4, BBr3, and N2 in the presence of potassium. The resultant BCN‐graphene
    has boron and nitrogen contents of 2.38 and 2.66 atom %, respectively, and displays
    good dispersion stability in N‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone, allowing for solution casting
    fabrication of a field‐effect transistor. The device displays an on/off ratio
    of 10.7 with an optical band gap of 3.3 eV. Considering the scalability of the
    production method and the benefits of solution processability, BCN‐graphene has
    high potential for many practical applications.

  abstract: The maximum responsivity of a pure monolayer graphene‐based photodetector
    is currently less than 10 mA W−1 because of small optical absorption and short
    recombination lifetime. Here, a graphene hybrid photodetector functionalized with
    a photoactive ruthenium complex that shows an ultrahigh responsivity of ≈1 × 105
    A W−1 and a photoconductive gain of ≈3 × 106 under incident optical intensity
    of the order of sub‐milliwatts is reported. This responsivity is two orders of
    magnitude higher than the precedent best performance of graphene‐based photodetectors
    under a similar incident light intensity. Upon functionalization with a 4‐nm‐thick
    ruthenium complex, monolayer graphene‐based photodetectors exhibit pronounced
    n‐type doping effect due to electron transfer via the metal−ligand charge transfer
    (MLCT) from the ruthenium complex to graphene. The ultrahigh responsivity is attributed
    to the long lifetime and high mobility of the photoexcited charge carriers. This
    approach is highly promising for improving the responsivity of graphene‐based
    photodetectors.
